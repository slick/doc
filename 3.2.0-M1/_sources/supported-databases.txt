Other SQL databases can be accessed right away with a reduced feature set.
Writing a fully featured plugin for your own SQL-based backend can be achieved
with a reasonable amount of work. Support for other backends (like NoSQL) is
under development but not yet available.

The following capabilities are supported by the profiles. "Yes" means that a
capability is fully supported. In other cases it may be partially supported or
not at all. See the individual profile's API documentation for details.
